I\`m looking to improve the UX around the Editor Component and to incorporate grammar/rewrite capabilities. It seems Telerik Components are bit light when it comes to AI integration and don\`t see anything on the roadmap either.  
  
For comparison Syncfusion have a whole set of integrations ([Introducing the AI-Powered Smart Blazor Components and Features (syncfusion.com)](https://www.syncfusion.com/blogs/post/ai-powered-smart-blazor-components)) and specifically one for their Editor which gives it grammar/rewrite/summarisation capabilities.  
  
All I\`ve found from Telerik is the AI Prompt which is only useful if you\`re looking for a chatbot experience.

[Display the prompt and output for the AIPrompt as one view](/forums/display-the-prompt-and-output-for-the-aiprompt-as-one-view "Display the prompt and output for the AIPrompt as one view")

I am wondering if it is possible to change the AIPrompt to be a bit more like a chat then a separate request/prompt, and then having it as it currently operates as separate window/tab displaying the prompt and user response and the second tab having the output to the prompt.   It would seem to me that it is smoother to have it all in one, rather than separate.   Is there any solution?
